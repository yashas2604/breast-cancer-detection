Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning techniques (CNN) to detect and classify breast cancer using histopathological images from the [BreaKHis dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambarish/breakhis).

##  Objective

To build a CNN-based classification model that can distinguish between benign and malignant breast cancer tissue images using the BreaKHis dataset.
